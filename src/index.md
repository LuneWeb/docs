## Recommended Toolchain Managers

```shell [rokit]
rokit init
rokit add luneweb/luneweb
```

```shell [cargo-install]
cargo install --git https://github.com/luneweb/luneweb
```

## Other Toolchain Managers

You can also install luneweb through `aftman` or `foreman`

foreman is supposed to be used for internal roblox projects
so that tool is not recommended

aftman installs the windows version of luneweb on linux
so that tool isn't recommended either

## Install manually

You can manually download LuneWeb from
[Github](https://github.com/luneweb/luneweb/releases/latest)
